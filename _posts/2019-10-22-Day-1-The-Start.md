title: Day 1 - The Start of the Adventure
---

The first post is probably the most boring post, not sure what to say, not sure where this is going, which means its just a sort of rambling shambling post.  Learning another new piece of technology in order to get this up and running in an easy way.  Using github pages, and jekyll makes for an easy transition.  jekyll is something that I will have to spend time learning in order to one day have a fancy blogs.  For right now, it is just the vehicle to start tracking this great quest to move into a new rising set of technologys: Machine Learning, Data Science, and fun with AI.  I look forward to writing an AI that can play a game all on its own.

I've been casually watching videos and learning little tidbits when it comes to machine learning for months now, but I've finally decided to dive in, get a course cirriculum and start making something interesting.  At least then I can show people interesting things I've made(copied, in order to learn) and not just things I want to learn how to make.  One day I'll come up with something all on my own that someone, somewhere may copy on their own in order to learn something.  There is a pile of math to learn, more python, and so many other things.  I have a solid python background, but this is definitely moving in a direction that is partially out of my comfort zone. 

The cirriculum I'm going to follow comes from two different places. The first is dataquest.io, which has solid tracks for learning data science.  The second is MIT opencourseware, which I will use for all the math.  All the math.

I completed the first project from dataquest.io and have linked the jupyter notebook below.  It was a fun project, and while I didn't learn a lot, I did learn some interesting tidbits.  The main takeaway was the methodology for working through cleaning and preparing files for futher analysis.  Some of the techniques, like looping, I would not have used, but it was how the course wanted it done.  Enjoy and until next time.
